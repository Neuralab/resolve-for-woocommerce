Resolve for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Resolve is a complete B2B credit management and net terms solution that helps your customers get net terms while you get paid faster. If you’re looking for a better way to manage the nightmare of customer credit checks, net terms risk, payments, and cash flow woes - Resolve is here to help. We believe your business shouldn’t act like a bank unless you’re actually a bank. Get paid by Resolve in a day, and we’ll let your customers pay us in 30, 60, or 90 days. However your customers buy from you, e-commerce or off-line, we've got you covered.

This extension allows B2B merchants to offer Net Terms to their customers without the hassle of running credit checks, floating short-term credit, chasing payments, and processing payments. When customers request to pay by invoice (e.g., Net 30), Resolve credit checks them and assesses their risk profile. Once approved for net terms, customers can select the “Pay with Net Terms” payment selection in the checkout, which gives them 30-90 days to pay while you get paid sooner.
