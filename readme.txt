Resolve for WooCommerce.

== Description ==

Resolve at its core improves traditional and cumbersome b2b payments. We facilitate deferred payments between businesses, but in a way that benefits both businesses. This deferred payment is commonly referred to as ‘net terms’ in many industries, and it describes a payment delay of 30, 60, or 90 days that has come to be expected by business customers. The issue for the business seller is that they are required to act like a bank. They need to give short-term credit to their customers and ‘float’ these net terms invoice payments. Resolve takes care of every aspect of a business being able to offer net terms as a payment option. We solve for the credit checking process, provide invoice financing, automate accounts receivable processes, and speed up payments processing.

Resolve enables b2b deferred payments through our end-to-end and embedded ‘credit billing’ solution. This refers to Resolve’s integration with an existing financial tech stack to automate and streamline all of the tasks associated with offering net terms. The results are simpler net terms that increase our customer’s cash flow and b2b sales, while reducing their financial risk and accounts receivable resourcing needs.
